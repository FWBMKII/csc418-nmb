	The basic ray-tracer contains three parts to do: 
	1. the ray casting in file "raytracer.cpp"
	2. Intersection functions for both sphere and square objects in file "scene_object.cpp"
	3. Phong shading for a point light source in file "light_source.cpp"

For each pixel of the image, a ray would be casted in fuction render( int width, int height, Point3D eye, Vector3D view, Vector3D up, double fov, char* fileName ) in raytracer. For each ray, its intersection with the square and sphere objects would be culculated by two functions in file scene_object. And the final colour after shadign applied would be culculated by function shade( Ray3d& ray) in file light_source. After all, two images would be generated to show the final looks of two views of camera.

After file is made, it can generate two images "view1.bmp" and "view2.bmp" that is the view at current render type. To change the render type, need to de-comment the output line in file "light_source.cpp". There are totaly three render types supported: 1.scene signature, 2.diffuse and ambient, 3.Phong. Six images that represents three render type in two views had already been generated and involved in the directory. 

Response:
Yifei Yang: ray casting, intersection cluculate.

Mingye Wang: shading, generating required images, report.
