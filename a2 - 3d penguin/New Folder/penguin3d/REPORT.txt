For this assignment what I have completed is that:
Draw 5 different penguins in 3d space which includes line only penguin, all white penguin, white penguin with line, matellic penguin and matte penguin.

Penguin is displayed by drawing head,topbeek,botbeek,body,leftarm,lefthand, rightarm,righthand, both legs and both feet.
Head can rotate around y-axis centered at top of the body.
Botbeek can move up and down.
Both arm can rotate 3 directions and hand can rotate around x-axis.
Both two legs can rotate 3 directions and feet can rotate around z-axis.

Every face has an associated normal drawn to it.

WIREFRAME draws a penguin with only lines.
SOILD draws a white penguin.
OUTLINE draws a white penguin with lines.
Matte  draws a not shinny penguin consider light.
Matellic draws a shinny penguin consider light.


The light is setting up far away from the penguin with y =1 and radius is 1 with x^2+z^2=1 which means 180 degrees rotate around the penguin.

Keyframe animation is changed by using updateKeyframe in order to show a rotating penguin and a regular moving penguin.
